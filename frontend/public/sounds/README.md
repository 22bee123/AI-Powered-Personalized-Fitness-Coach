# Sound Files

This directory contains sound files used in the workout timer:

1. `countdown-end.mp3` - Played when the countdown timer reaches zero
2. `exercise-complete.mp3` - Played when an exercise is marked as complete

These sound files should be in MP3 format and kept small in size for optimal performance.

Note: The actual sound files need to be added to this directory. You can use royalty-free sounds from sources like:
- https://freesound.org/
- https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/
- https://www.zapsplat.com/

After downloading appropriate sound files, rename them to match the expected filenames.
